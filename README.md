# CRDT
In distributed computing, a conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) is a data structure which can be replicated across multiple computers in a network, where the replicas can be updated independently and concurrently without coordination between the replicas, and where it is always mathematically possible to resolve inconsistencies that might come up.

Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures that power real-time collaborative applications in distributed systems. CRDTs can be replicated across systems, they can be updated independently and concurrently might result.

The project implements a state-based LWW-Element-Graph with test cases.
